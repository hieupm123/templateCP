So now i just need to go down in main and do insertion sort. Type newarray and insertion sort
is the only option for that put that there and if i typed everything let's excute
it looks like everything worked out. Let's come down inside of here and we can see
everything is in ascending order which is exactly what we wanted it to do. Now let's come up the insertion sort and it let's actually watch what it does so basically
these two values are 1 and 1 which we know are true because that's exactly. What's going on there now that we're going to do is we're going to check ok is 12 less than 
19 no that's not true. Now is 19 greater than 11 yes it is so what we're going to do is store this value 11 in to sort and then we're going to take 19 and paste
that value right there so that 19 is now in the right place and then we're going to take the 12 because remember 11 is what we need to move in here we're going to copy 12
to this place right here and then finally we're going to take the 11 and put it in the position where it needs to be now we have three numbers right in order here pretty quickly then we need to go through and check whether 19 deserves to be these or whether 11 should move down we're going to store the value of 11 inside of there put the value of 19 right there go do the same thing with 12 by copying it right there and then putting our other 11 right there and you can see we're more quickly getting everything in order however we don't have large groups for example 10 still here where with the other sorts that would have been up here much quicker you can see that we're slowly putting everything in order and that process is just going to continue onwards and onwards and onwards until we get down here and we have everything in proper order so there are a whole bunch or all of the elementary ways of sorting in regards to java algorithms as well as to different ways to search and a brand new tool for us to analyze all of our data structures if you have any questions or coments  leave them in the comment section below otherwise till next time.
